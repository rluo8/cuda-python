``cuda-pathfinder`` 1.3.5 Release notes
=======================================

Released on Feb 23, 2026

.. warning::

   ``cuda-pathfinder==1.3.5`` introduced a short-lived backward-incompatible
   exception regression in ``load_nvidia_dynamic_lib()`` (unsupported
   library names incorrectly raising ``ValueError``).

   This bug was corrected in ``cuda-pathfinder>=1.4.0``, restoring backward-compatible
   ``DynamicLibNotFoundError`` subclass behavior while preserving more specific
   error signaling.

   See `Issue #1684 <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-python/issues/1684>`_ and
   `PR #1688 <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-python/pull/1688>`_.

Highlights
----------

* Add support for loading NVIDIA driver libraries (``"cuda"``, ``"nvml"``)
  via ``load_nvidia_dynamic_lib()``, and reject unsupported library names
  with ``ValueError`` (**EDIT:** this behavior was
  `a regression <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-python/issues/1684>`_
  and was corrected in ``cuda-pathfinder>=1.4.0``).
  (`PR #1602 <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-python/pull/1602>`_)

* Add bitcode library discovery helpers and public API support, including
  ``find_bitcode_lib()``, ``locate_bitcode_lib()``, and ``SUPPORTED_BITCODE_LIBS``.
  (`PR #1218 <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-python/pull/1218>`_)
